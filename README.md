# Sentiment_Analysis_Of_News
This project collects top ten recent news articles from https://www.aljazeera.com/where/mozambique/ and performs sentiment analysis on them to classify them
in three categories - "Positive", "Negative" and "Neutral".

A pre-trained model Vader is used to perform the sentiment analysis and pyplot library is used to visualize the results. The collaboratory notebook can be 
run directly and includes all the installations. The external dependencies are also specified in requirements.txt file. The total run time required to 
get articles from web and classify them is 36 seconds approximately. The articles are also saved in a json file for reference.
